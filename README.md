This Jupyter Notebook presents an analysis and prediction model for determining health outcomes in horses. The notebook utilizes various data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and build a predictive model. The dataset includes information on different features related to horse health, such as peripheral pulse, outcome, and more.

The notebook begins with importing necessary libraries and dependencies, followed by loading the dataset and performing concatenation for additional analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to gain insights into the dataset, and preprocessing steps are implemented to prepare the data for modeling.

Machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost and LightGBM, are utilized to train the predictive model. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess the model's performance. Additionally, feature selection techniques, learning curves, and cross-validation are employed for model optimization.

The notebook also includes references to relevant articles and resources that were consulted during the analysis. The goal of this notebook is to showcase the author's data science skills and invite feedback and suggestions for improvement.
